# ONRAMP-01-WEEK-ONE

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible using HTML and CSS.


The designs are in in the `/utils/design' folder which contains a fig file that can be viewed using figma and contains information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.


You will find all the required assets(images and icons) in the `/utils/assets` folder. The assets are already optimized.

Get colors, fonts etc from the `utils/design/style-guide` file or by opening the fig file in `/utils/figma`

All code should be written in the `/src` folder.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


Make sure to check the wiki tab on git for the assessment workflow (a guide on how to setup git for version control on the project).

Happy coding!
